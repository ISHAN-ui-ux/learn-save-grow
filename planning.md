Prompt to build:

I want to revamp my learning paths section. I only want three lesson here as above for beginner, intermediate and advanced tags. Please use the associated websites to build the content for the slides in each lesson, each slide should be comprehensive but easy to understand. I want the structure of each lesson to be 10 slides. after 5 slides, there should be a 5 question quiz that tests the user's knowledge so far and immediately checks the answers and shows the right one. at the end of 10 slides theres a 10 question test to test as well with same checking answers and showing right/wrong. make sure the complete lesson button at the end works to come back to home page and shows the lesson as completed.
